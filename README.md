# GameSpotFinalProject
A Lamp-stack Web Application developed for the Maryville MS Software Dev. Capstone Project course

## Project Idea 
The main purpose of this project is to develop a web application that incorporates three main components: user interface, database, and service layers. These components will be used to communicate data between the back-end (database) and front-end (user interface). I will be designing, developing, testing, and deploying my own application. The goal is that demonstrating these completed components will show a mastery of our abilities to developer a software artifact.

## Project Description 
The capstone project will incoporate user interactivity with the web application. The user must be able to do something or perform a task when working with the web application. My capstone project idea is a Ecommerce Web Application System for a brick and mortar video game company that can be used by their customers and employees. The user will be able to purchase products, leave a review, and interact with other customers in the social media feature of the website.
